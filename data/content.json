A set of neurdegenerative diseases including Zellweger's syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease are due to loss of or defective peroxisome function. The goal was to potentially find a master regulatory controller of peroxisome genes. I also had the opportunity to research the CRISPR-Cas9 system and design guide RNAs for gene-knockout experiments.",
